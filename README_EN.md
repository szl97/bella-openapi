Bella OpenAPI is an API gateway providing rich AI capabilities, comparable to openrouter. Unlike openrouter, in addition to chat-completion capabilities, it also offers text-embedding, automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), text-to-image, image-to-image, and many other AI capabilities, while integrating billing, rate limiting, and resource management functionalities. All integrated capabilities have been validated in large-scale production environments.

- **Dynamic Routing**: Intelligently selects the most appropriate service channel based on user requests and configuration to improve service quality

### High-performance Cache Design

- **Multi-level Cache Architecture**: Combines Redisson, Caffeine, and JetCache to implement collaborative work between local cache and distributed cache
- **High Throughput**: Local cache reduces network overhead, distributed cache ensures cluster consistency
- **Automatic Expiration Mechanism**: Intelligent cache expiration strategy balances data consistency and performance

### High-performance Log Processing Framework

## Quick Start

This project uses Docker Compose to start all services, including backend API, frontend Web, MySQL, and Redis.

### Prerequisites

- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Execution directory must be in the root directory of the bella-openapi project

### Starting the Service

If the image doesn't exist locally, it will pull from the remote repository

```bash
./start.sh 
./start.sh --github-oauth CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET --google-oauth CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET --server URL (configure oauth login service and service domain through startup parameters)
```
Note: If you need to configure user login, see: [OAuth Configuration](https://doc.bella.top/en/docs/bella-openapi/configuration-details#oauth-configuration)

- After starting the service, it will automatically check if a system ak exists; if not, it will generate a system ak and administrator authorization
- If you don't want to perform administrator authorization at startup (it will still check if the system ak needs to be generated), you can use the `--skip-auth` parameter:

```bash
./start.sh --skip-auth
```

Common options:
- `-b, --build`: Rebuild services after code modification
- `--github-oauth CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET`: Configure GitHub OAuth login
- `--google-oauth CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET`: Configure Google OAuth login
- `--server URL`: Configure service domain
- `--skip-auth`: Skip administrator authorization process

For more detailed startup options and configuration instructions, please refer to [Startup and Deployment Details](https://doc.bella.top/en/docs/bella-openapi/startup-deployment-details).

## FAQ and Solutions

### 1. Frontend compilation fails when using development environment with the startup script

Next.js has implemented preloading optimizations in the dev environment. If you must use the dev environment, it's recommended to use next.dev to start the web service separately.

### 2. Initialize and start the system, clearing existing data (development, testing environment)

1. Delete database: `docker exec -it bella-openapi-mysql mysql -uroot -p123456 -e "drop database bella_openapi;"` (replace with your username and password if they're different from default)
2. Stop services: `docker-compose down`
3. Delete MySQL data: `rm -rf ./mysql`
4. Delete Redis data: `rm -rf ./redis`
5. Rebuild and restart: `./start.sh -b`
